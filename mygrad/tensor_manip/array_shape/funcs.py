    """ Returns a tensor with a new shape, without changing its data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : array_like
            The tensor to be reshaped

        newshape : Tuple[int, ...]
            The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
            an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
            One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
            inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.

        constant : bool, optional(default=False)
            If ``True``, the returned tensor is a constant (it
            does not back-propagate a gradient)

        Returns
        -------
        mygrad.Tensor
            ``a`` with its shape changed permuted.  A new tensor is returned.

        Notes
        -----
        ``reshape`` utilizes C-ordering, meaning that it reads & writes elements using
        C-like index ordering; the last axis index changing fastest, and, proceeding
        in reverse order, the first axis index changing slowest. """
